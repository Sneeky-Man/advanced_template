# Credits
### This is a list of all the code I have used from other people's code (excluding anything i nicked off stackoverflow. I can't have this being too long)

#### View Code
* Code for the views was taken from the [Community Platformer](https://github.com/pythonarcade/community-platformer)
* I also based a lot of the README off the platformer.
* I also also used alot of their GUI code, since arcades GUI system honestly scares me.
